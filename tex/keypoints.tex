\begin{keypoints}
\item Inverse modeling of turbidity currents from spatial variation of thickness and grain-size distribution of turbidites along 1D transect is proposed based on the machine learning technique.
\item Sets of training data are produced by numerical simulations of the 1D layer-averaged forward model.
\item The neural network explores the empirical relationship between initial conditions and characteristics of deposits from training data sets.
\item After the machine learning procedures are completed, the neural network works as the inverse model of turbidity currents.
